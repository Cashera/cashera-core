How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all
earlier versions of Cashera, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy
over /Applications/Cashera-Qt (on Mac) or Casherad/Cashera-qt (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from version 1.4.1 or earlier, the first time you run
3.0.0 your blockchain files may be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 
30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.

On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Cashera
client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version.

Windows 64-bit installer
-------------------------

It is recommended to install the 64-bit version if your system supports it.

NOTE: Release candidate Windows binaries are not code-signed; use PGP
and the SHA256SUMS.asc file to make sure your binaries are correct.
In the final 3.0.0 release, Windows setup.exe binaries will be code-signed.

OSX 10.5 / 32-bit no longer supported
-------------------------------------

3.0.0 drops support for older Macs. The minimum requirements are now:
* A 64-bit-capable CPU (see http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3696);
* Mac OS 10.6 or later (see https://support.apple.com/kb/ht1633).

Downgrading warnings
--------------------

The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 3.0.0 and then decide to switch back to a
1.4.x release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the
old release (due to 'pruned outputs' being omitted from the index of
unspent transaction outputs).

Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate
data structures and correct the problem.

Also, the first time you run a 1.4.x release on a 3.0.0 wallet it will rescan
the blockchain for missing spent coins, which will take a long time (tens
of minutes on a typical machine).

Rebranding to Cashera Core
---------------------------

To reduce confusion between Cashera-the-network and Cashera-the-software we
have renamed the reference client to Cashera Core.


Autotools build system
-----------------------

For 3.0.0 we continue to use an autotools-based build system instead of individual
(q)makefiles.

Using the standard "./autogen.sh; ./configure; make" to build Cashera-Qt and
Casherad makes it easier for experienced open source developers to contribute 
to the project.

Be sure to check doc/build-*.md for your platform before building from source.

Blockchain Download
------------------------------------

Blockchain data for both testnet and mainnet along with instructions can be downloaded from github.
